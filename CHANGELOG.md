## 2026-11-01 — Calendar filters, all-day handling, and test stabilization

- Updated Calendar selected-day filtering to distinguish All, Unfinished, timed Reminders, and Phone Calendar sources.
- Kept all-day Task entries visible in All and Unfinished, excluded them from the timed Reminder filter, and ordered all-day entries before timed entries in the selected-day list.
- Added widget coverage for the four source filters, all-day inclusion/exclusion, and selected-day ordering.
- Scoped the canonical launcher test's Today label assertion to the primary navigation so the second Today label elsewhere in the page cannot create a false duplicate match.
- Made the Home grouping contract test use a deterministic expanded test viewport rather than relying on a scrollable finder that was not present in the tested tree.
- These changes require fresh exact-HEAD CI confirmation; no test result is inferred from source edits.
