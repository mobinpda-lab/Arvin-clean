# CI Release Validation Note

**Updated:** 2026-09-08

Arvin v1 release validation consumes repository-owned build inputs. Release workflows must not regenerate or patch critical Android/Gradle configuration at runtime.

Canonical reproducible inputs:
- Flutter SDK: `3.47.0`
- dependency graph: committed `pubspec.lock`, resolved with `flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile`
- Android project: committed `android/` configuration and Gradle wrapper
- Gradle: `9.3.1`
- Android Gradle Plugin: `9.1.0`
- Kotlin Android plugin: `2.4.0`
- Java/JVM target: `17`
- core-library desugaring: `com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.1.5`
- VazirHarf source revision: `3cbc943b9fb9107baa77008b3e96b3c3e40e9ed8`

`Arvin Build`, `Arvin Device Smoke`, `Arvin Release Closure`, and `Arvin Final Head Release Validation` must validate these tracked inputs directly. Dependency resolution must fail on lock incompatibility and must not rewrite `pubspec.lock` silently.

Android SDK compile/min/target values remain provided by the pinned Flutter 3.47.0 Gradle integration referenced by the tracked Android project; changing Flutter or the Android toolchain requires explicit lock/toolchain revalidation.

This release-engineering contract does not change Task, Reminder, FollowUp, Calendar, migration, storage, or production save semantics.
