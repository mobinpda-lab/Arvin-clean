# Arvin Execution State

Updated: 2026-10-11 (restore reconciliation and portable settings implementation; exact-head validation in progress)
Repository: https://github.com/mobinpda-lab/Arvin-clean
GitHub access: Read/Write verified by live operations.
Authority: live GitHub refs, source, tests and workflow evidence.

## Current release state
**IN PROGRESS — RELEASE BLOCKED.** No physical-device acceptance has been provided.

## Last completed step
- Read this state and `ARVIN_EVIDENCE_MAP.md` first, then rechecked PR #2585, Issue #2580, the relevant backup/settings/task/notebook sources, and current-head Actions.
- Owner approval for standalone Category/Tag portability was already recorded in PR #2585 and Issue #2580. The later owner-approved expansion requires notes/notebook checklists and portable app settings, stable-ID reconciliation, preservation of local-only records, omitted-key safety for legacy settings, and rollback across stores.
- Implemented in the existing branch `fix-backup-taxonomy-catalogs-20261010`, without a parallel restore engine:
  - `ArvinBackupManager.reconcileTasksById`: matching Task IDs update, backup-only Tasks add, local-only Tasks remain.
  - Project reconciliation uses stable Project IDs and preserves memberships for local-only Tasks.
  - Settings merge only applies supplied keys, including nested Calendar, backup schedule and Daily Content preferences. Explicit nullable defaults are serialized; older backups that omit a key do not reset it.
  - Daily Content preferences are included in foreground and scheduled backup payloads and validated before restore writes.
  - Scheduled backups now include Calendar-link metadata and canonical Category/Tag catalogs in addition to Tasks, Projects and portable settings.
  - Added tests for Task/Project reconciliation, local-only Notebook/checklist retention, partial legacy settings, explicit nullable settings and scheduled-backup payload contents.
- Current code PR #2585 head: `5f59d7c7edb12217a2aa3f7a139a042676dc0e76`. Exact-head Analyze is SUCCESS; all six test shards and Debug/Release APK jobs are running, and Device Smoke is queued. Previous exact heads exposed a settings expectation and three stale test contracts for replace-only restore; those expectations were updated to the approved ID-reconciliation contract before the current head.
- PR #2585 remains OPEN / NOT MERGED. CI and emulator results do not prove real Android system file-picker/provider acceptance.
- Main base observed for PR #2585: `72a2f4cc24df7a38eff9856ce403461615db5280` (documentation-only PCTADP decision registration).
- Calendar linked-event edit [PR #2570](https://github.com/mobinpda-lab/Arvin-clean/pull/2570) is merged at [`34a6cee`](https://github.com/mobinpda-lab/Arvin-clean/commit/34a6cee9ae05ad1cf632960b96e98f2a5448e128); physical-device proof remains absent.
- Calendar action visibility/recurrence [PR #2587](https://github.com/mobinpda-lab/Arvin-clean/pull/2587) remains OPEN / NOT MERGED at `4442ce450e4295e500a9db6d5dc5b4d9657b3770`; historical exact-head Build #38089112669 and Device Smoke #38089112675 succeeded across emulator lanes. Physical-device acceptance remains absent.
- Memory documentation [PR #2600](https://github.com/mobinpda-lab/Arvin-clean/pull/2600) remains OPEN / DRAFT; this state refresh is on its existing documentation branch.

## Current GitHub reality
- [Issue #2580](https://github.com/mobinpda-lab/Arvin-clean/issues/2580) remains open for the repository-wide Project/Category/Tag ontology audit. Owner approval for unused Category/Tag portability is recorded.
- [PR #2585](https://github.com/mobinpda-lab/Arvin-clean/pull/2585) is the sole implementation path for backup/restore changes. Current head `254b86c`; exact-head Analyze succeeded, full Build and Device Smoke remain pending at this checkpoint.
- Existing canonical storage remains authoritative: Tasks/Notebook items use TaskStore; Projects use ProjectStore; Category/Tag catalogs use TaskStore; Calendar-link identity uses ExternalCalendarLinkStore. No duplicate storage or restore engine was added.
- Notes and Notebook checklists are canonical Task records; backup paths load the full TaskStore rather than a filtered Home projection.
- Portable settings currently include AppSettingsService values, backup schedule and Daily Content preferences. Device-bound folder/provider URIs, secrets and transient encryption passphrases are not portable settings.
- Catalog merge remains additive and backward-compatible; formatVersion remains 1 and older backups may omit optional catalog/settings fields.

## Taxonomy audit findings (partial)
- `lib/models/task.dart`: `Task.category` and `Task.tags` are separate.
- `lib/models/goal_project.dart`: Project membership stores canonical Task IDs in `itemIds`; this model does not declare a Category relation.
- `lib/home/grouping/home_grouping_service.dart`: `HomeGroup<Task>` is a presentation grouping abstraction, not proof of a fourth domain entity.
- `lib/services/task_store.dart`: canonical Category catalog uses SQL `taxonomy_categories`; canonical Tag catalog uses SQL `tags`.
- `lib/services/tag_store.dart` defines legacy SharedPreferences key `arvin.tags`, but current search found no caller; migration derives SQL Tag rows from `Task.tags`, not `arvin.tags`. Keep this as a low-confidence legacy candidate and do not delete/migrate it without evidence it was populated by a shipped path.
- Source review confirmed the original backup gap for unused standalone Category/Tag catalog entries. The existing PR now serializes these catalog values and merges them additively with regression coverage. Exact-head tests are still pending.
- Do not infer a physical Category-to-Project foreign key from the semantic hierarchy. Do not mass-replace “group”; classify domain, user-facing, presentation, generic technical and historical uses first.

## In progress
1. Complete exact-head Build for PR #2585: Analyze, all six test shards, Debug APK and Release APK.
2. Complete exact-head Android Device Smoke; inspect any failing shard/job and repair safely before claiming success.
3. Verify backup/restore round-trip with legacy v1 backups, unused + assigned catalogs, settings, notes/checklists, stable-ID reconciliation and late-stage rollback.
4. Complete physical Android system file-picker/provider and before/after data-integrity acceptance; emulator smoke is not a substitute.
5. Continue the repository-wide Project/Category/Tag audit and keep PR #2585 and #2587 open until physical acceptance is evidenced.

## Blocked / unproven
- Exact-head Build and Device Smoke for `254b86c` are still running/queued at this update.
- Physical Android file-picker/provider backup and restore, failed-restore recovery and real data-integrity acceptance.
- Physical-device Calendar same-ID edit/no-duplicate behavior, action visibility, recurrence/checklist acceptance.
- Full Golden Flow: Task → time → Project → Checklist → Repeat → Tracking → Calendar → Backup → Restore.
- Full taxonomy conformance inventory and final release handover/owner acceptance.

## Next actions
- Poll exact-head Actions for `5f59d7c7edb12217a2aa3f7a139a042676dc0e76`; use only evidence attached to that exact head.
- If any job fails, inspect its log, fix the root cause in the same PR, and rerun validation on the new head.
- Update the evidence map after Build/Smoke settles, then continue physical-device acceptance and remaining taxonomy audit.
- Keep PRs open/unmerged; never claim release readiness from CI alone.

## Risk rules
Task remains the source of truth for Tasks and Notebook items; Calendar is a projection; Repeat must not create copied Tasks; preserve stable Task ID and external event ID. No merge/release based on CI alone. Never claim user/device acceptance without direct evidence.
